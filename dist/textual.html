                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>When visitors leave comments on
                        the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address and
                        browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>


                    <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the
                        Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available
                        here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is
                        visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>


                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Media</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you upload images to the
                        website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included.
                        Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cookies</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you leave a comment on our
                        site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for
                        your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another
                        comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>


                    <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts
                        cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>


                    <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your
                        screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a
                        year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your
                        account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>


                    <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This
                        cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just
                        edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>


                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Embedded content from other websites</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>Articles on this site may
                        include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other
                        websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>


                    <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
                        and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction
                        with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>


                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who we share your data with</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you request a password reset,
                        your IP address will be included in the reset email.</p>


                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">How long we retain your data</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you leave a comment, the
                        comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any
                        follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>


                    <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
                        provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at
                        any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
                        edit that information.</p>


                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What rights you have over your data</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>If you have an account on this
                        site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we
                        hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase
                        any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
                        administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>


                    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where your data is sent</h2>


                    <p><strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">Suggested text: </strong>Visitor comments may be checked
                        through an automated spam detection service.</p>
